#  Arduino Relay Module Control

This project demonstrates how to interface a **two-channel relay module** with an **Arduino** to control **two LEDs**. The LEDs toggle on and off to visually represent how the relay operates â€” simulating the switching of electrical devices.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**
   In the `setup()` function, relay control pins are configured as **OUTPUT** and initialized to a **LOW** state (relays off).

2. **Loop Operation**
   The `loop()` function alternates the relay states:

   * Turns **Relay 1 ON** and **Relay 2 OFF**, waits for 1 second.
   * Turns **Relay 1 OFF** and **Relay 2 ON**, waits for 1 second.

3. **LED Indication**
   Each LED lights up when its respective relay is activated â€” providing a visual representation of relay switching.

## ðŸ§  Example Code

```cpp
// Pin definitions
const int RELAY1 = 7;
const int RELAY2 = 8;

void setup() {
  pinMode(RELAY1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(RELAY2, OUTPUT);

  // Start with both relays OFF
  digitalWrite(RELAY1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(RELAY2, LOW);
}

void loop() {
  // Relay 1 ON, Relay 2 OFF
  digitalWrite(RELAY1, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(RELAY2, LOW);
  delay(1000);

  // Relay 1 OFF, Relay 2 ON
  digitalWrite(RELAY1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(RELAY2, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
}
```

## Safety Precautions

* **Low Voltage Only:** This example uses **5V LEDs**.
  If connecting to higher-voltage devices, use appropriate insulation and safety procedures.
* **Disconnect Power:** Always remove power before wiring or adjusting the circuit.
* **Avoid Overload:** Ensure connected devices do not exceed the relayâ€™s rated current/voltage.

## Future Enhancements

* Control AC appliances (bulbs, fans) through relays.
* Integrate with sensors (e.g., temperature, light) for automated switching.
* Add Wi-Fi or Bluetooth control for remote operation.
